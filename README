This repository provides integration scripts to build complete standalone
SDK (with toolchain) for software development for Espressif ESP8266,
ESP8266EX chips.

Complete SDK consists of:

1. Xtensa lx106 architecture toolchain (100% OpenSource), based on
following projects:

https://github.com/jcmvbkbc/crosstool-NG
https://github.com/jcmvbkbc/gcc-xtensa
https://github.com/jcmvbkbc/newlib-xtensa
https://github.com/tommie/lx106-hal

The sourcecode above originates from work done directly by Tensilica Inc.,
Cadence Design Systems, Inc, or their contractors.

2. ESP8266 IoT SDK from Espressif Systems. This component is only partially
open source, some libraries provided as binary blobs.

OpenSource components of SDK are based on:

lwIP, http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/
Contiki, http://www.contiki-os.org/
axTLS, http://axtls.sourceforge.net/


Building
========

To build standalone SDK with toolchain, you need GNU/POSIX system (Linux,
BSD, MacOSX, Windows with Cygwin) with standard GNU development tools
installed, like gcc, binutils, flex, bison, etc.

To start build process run:

    make

This will download all necessary components and compile them. Once done,
the toolchain (with Xtensa HAL library) will be available in toolchain/
directory. Add its bin/ subdirectory to execute "xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc"
and other tools.

ESP8266 SDK will be installed in sdk/, to use it, run the compiler with
corresponding include and lib dir flags:

xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc -I$(THISDIR)/sdk/include -L$(THISDIR)/sdk/lib
